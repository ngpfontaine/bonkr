# BONKR
> _Acronym_: **B**oilerplate - **O**pinionated _(kinda)_ **N**a**K**ed &amp; **R**esponsive   

Bonkr is a normalized CSS boilerplate with a focus on **style-agnostic** usability, a simple **layout system**, and **responsive flexibility**.   

It's created as a starter-template with default component proportions & weight and some basic styling that won't conflict with yours, + some nice (and independant) features like [dialogs](https://nicfontaine.com/dev/bonkr#dialogs#dialogs) and a [loader](https://nicfontaine.com/dev/bonkr#dialogs)    

You won't find any **colours**, **embedded fonts**, or **navigation** here - just a beautiful blank-slate for your content.
